# Jammming


A React web app to quickly create Spotify playlists!

The wanted songs can be typed in the search bar, with results appearing in the left box.

After finding the desidered song, by pressing on the "+" it'll be added to the current playlist.

Once all the desired songs are added, the playlist can be named and saved. After being saved, it will be instantly available in Spotify.

Check npm_instructions.md to run the app locally.
